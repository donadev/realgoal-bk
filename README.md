# RealGoal - Soccer Results App

RealGoal is a simple Android app developed as a learning project during 5th grade of high school. It allows users to view real-time soccer results.

## About

The app is written in Java and uses a backend powered by Sails.js. It scrapes data from two API endpoints:

- `/matches/list` - Retrieves next matches. [Try it here](https://realgoal-api.onrender.com/matches/list)
- `/matches/detail?id=x` - Retrieves details for a specific match. [Try it here](https://realgoal-api.onrender.com/matches/detail?id=A7ZInGD0)

RealGoal is an unmaintained project developed 7 years ago (2017), intended as a learning exercise for understanding app development, API integration, and web scraping.
